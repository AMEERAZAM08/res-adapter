## Abstract

Recent advancement in text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and corresponding personalized technologies (e.g., DreamBooth and LoRA) enables individuals to generate high-quality and imaginative images.
However, they often suffer from limitations when generating images with resolutions outside of their trained domain.
To overcome this limitation, we present the Resolution Adapter (ResAdapter), a domain-consistent adapter designed for diffusion models to generate images with unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios.
Unlike other multi-resolution generation methods that process images of static resolution with complex post-process operations, ResAdapter directly generates images with the dynamical resolution.  
% This perspective enables the efficient inference without repeat denoising steps and complex post-process operations, thus eliminating the additional inference time.
Especially, after acquiring a deep understanding of pure resolution priors, ResAdapter trained on the general dataset, generates resolution-free images with personalized diffusion models while preserving their original style domain.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ResAdapter with only 0.5M can process images with flexible resolutions for arbitrary diffusion models.
More extended experiments demonstrate that ResAdapter is compatible with other modules (e.g., ControlNet, IP-Adapter and LCM-LoRA) for images across a broad range of resolutions, and can be integrated into other multi-resolution model (e.g., ElasticDiffusion) for efficiently generating higher-resolution images.

**Best Practice**
- For interpolation (generating images below the training resolution), we recommend setting `adapter_alpha=1.0`. 
- For extrapolation (generating images above the training resolution), we recommend the following adapter_alpha settings: When the inference resolution is greater than 1.5x the training resolution, we recommend setting `0.2<adapter_alpha<0.6`. When the inference resolution is less than or equal to 1.5x the training resolution, we recommend setting `0.6< adapter_alpha<1.0`.
- We strongly recommend that you use the prompt corresponding to the personalized model, which helps to enhance the quality of the image.
